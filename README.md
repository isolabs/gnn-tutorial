## Running on your own computer

Although Jupyter notebooks (```notebooks/```) and exported HTML files (```html/```) have been included in this repository for ease of viewing and sharing, you may still want to clone this repository and run / modify the code yourself.

To do this, use a conda-based package manager and install dependencies from the file ```env.yml``` .yml file. Do this using the following command (or similar):

```
conda env create -f env.yml
```

Activate this environment and run the ```jupyter notebook``` command.

This code has been confirmed to work with Conda 4.10.3.
